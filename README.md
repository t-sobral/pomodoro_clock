I am trying to build a Pomodoro clock.
  
This was made for my girlfriend, because she needed something to help her count the time she spent studying or focusing on anything in general.
  
  
The program was written on a linux OS so for now it will only work on a linux VM or OS, the notifications wont work on windows or mac for now.
